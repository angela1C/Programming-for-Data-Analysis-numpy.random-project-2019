It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. \n",

    "NumPy's main data structure is the **ndarray** - a homogenuous multidimensional array object. NumPy has many mathematical functions and algorithms for doing very fast numerical operations on arrays. Batch operations avoid the need to use loops by working on entire arrays of data at a time using **vectorisation** but using similar syntax to working with scalars.\n",
    "An [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. Python itself does not have an array data structure so the NumPy library allows for the creation and manipulatation of arrays of numbers. Although matrix operations are possible in Python, they are quite inefficient when compared to NumPy's capabilities on large multi-dimensional arrays of numbers and such matrix type operations are very commonly used when analysing data and for other computing purposes.
