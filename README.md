# numpy.random
This is the repository for the assignment for the Programming for Data Analysis Module as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics at GMIT.

The assignment concerns the **numpy.random** package in Python. 
It should explain the use of the package including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package. The four distinct tasks are as follows:.

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

The required documents for the assignment submission are in this git repository and include: 

-  this README file
- a git ignore file
- a Jupyter Notebook

The aim of the project is to look at the `numpy.random` package and to be able to describe it in your own words and in a less formal way than the documentation does. The project should not just recreate the entire `numpy.random` package documentation. Instead a handful of numpy.random functions are explored with the aid of plots, descriptive statistics or any other way possible to give a more real flavour of the package and its uses.


The project should be clearly organised and contain concise explanations of the particularities of the dataset. The analysis contained within the notebook will be well conceived, interesting, and well researched. 
Note that part of this assignment is about the use of Jupyter notebooks and so use should be made of all of the functionality available in the software including images, links, code and plots. 
Any addtional Python libraries may be used.
