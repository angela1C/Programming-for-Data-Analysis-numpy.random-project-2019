Raw Python's built-in matrix operations are quite inefficient when compared to NumPy's capabilities. NumPy is a specialist package that deals with multi-dimensional arrays that resemble lists within lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are rectangular in shape, such as 2-dimensional array where every row and every column have the same number of columns. The number of rows and columns can be different but each row must contain the same number of elements and each column contains the same number of elements.\n",

    "Operations can be performed on NumPy arrays very quickly. NumPy has many algorithms for dealing with numerical operations on arrays.\n",
    "NumPy can be used to simulate data. While csv data is commonly imported into NumPy for analysis (or more likely through the Python Pandas packages which uses NumPy in the background), it is often handy to be able to simulate data to analyse before the real data may be collected or available.\n",

    "NumPy is typically used through other packages. It is a specialist packages for dealing with arrays of numbers.

    "- NumPy has many mathematical functions that avoid the need to use loop as they work on entire arrays of data. \n",
    "- NumPy is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data which is partly due to the way NumPy stores data in a contiguous block of memory. NumPy's algorithms can operate on this memory without any type checking. NumPy arrays use much less memory than python's own built-in sequences. \n",

    ">Numpy’s random number routines produce pseudo random numbers using combinations of a BitGenerator to create sequences and a Generator to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **BitGenerators** are objects that generates random numbers which are typically unsigned integer words filled with sequences of either 32 or 64 random bits. \n",
    "- **Generators** objects then transform these sequences of random bits from the BitGenerator into sequences of numbers that follow a specific probability distribution within a specified interval.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    ">Since Numpy version 1.17.0 the Generator can be initialized with a number of different BitGenerators. It exposes many different probability distributions. See NEP 19 for context on the updated random Numpy number routines. The legacy RandomState random number routines are still available, but limited to a single BitGenerator.\n",
    "For convenience and backward compatibility, a single RandomState instance’s methods are imported into the numpy.random namespace, see Legacy Random Generation for the complete list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudorandom  numbers vs random numbers.\n",
    ">Pseudorandom  numbers are generated by an algorithm with deterministic behaviour based on the seed of the random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers generated by either the built-in random module or numpy.random package are not actually random at all but *pseudorandom* numbers. Computers cannot actually generate random numbers but they do generate sequences that look like random numbers. Computers generate numbers that looks random, so that someone else wouldn't be able to predict the next number generated without a key piece of information. This is the **seed**. If you know the seed then you can predict the next number to be generated in a sequence and therefore the numbers generated are not random as such. The seed is typically the time (to the microsecond) on the computer when the code was run. The seed is decided when you import the function into jupyter or python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lectured demonstrated the example of **pi** which is the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference. Pi has a decimal expansion that never ends and never repeats. Therefore you only ever see an approximation of pi becuase it has an unending expansion. \n",
    "The digits in pi never repeat a pattern and while you might find pairs of digits, these pairs do not appear periodically. \n",
    "Therefore if you wanted to generate a random number between 1 and 10, you could go out to a point in the decimal expansion and not tell anyone where you started, the position where you started from is the seed. If no-one knows where you start from, then no-one can predict where you go next. The seed is where you start at. If someone knows where in the decimal expansion you started from , then they could predict the next number in the \"random\" sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For various applications, you may wish to set a seed so that the exact sequence of random numbers can be generated. For example when testing code or for teaching purposes where you want the output to be reproducible you can set the seed. This tells Python not to generate a random seed at the start (from the time to the microsecond on the machine) and instead you provide it with a seed to start from to get the very same output another time.\n",

    "\n",
    "### numpy.random functions\n",

    "\n",
    "A random seed is a number used to initialise a pseudorandom number generator. This number does not need to be random. By setting the seed, the original seed is ignored and numbers will be generated in a pseudorandom manner. If you reinitialise a random number generator with the same seed then the same sequence of numbers will be produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [statisticshowto](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/random-seed-definition/), a random seed specifies the start point when a computer generates a random number. The random seed can be any number but it usually comes from seconds on the computer system's clock which counts in seconds from January 1, 1970.  (known as Unix time). This ensures that the same random sequence won't be repeated unless you actually want it to. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers generate random numbers in a *deterministic* way - that is by following a set of rules Randomness can be imitated by specifying a set of rules to follow. The algorithms behind computer number generation are based on patterns which generate numbers that follow a particular probability distribution.\n",

This value is nothing but a seed value. i.e. The random module uses the seed value as a base to generate a random number.\n",
