    "`NumPy` is a specialist Python package that works well with large arrays of numbers. Raw Python's built-in matrix operations are quite inefficient when compared to NumPy's capabilities. NumPy can work easily with multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy does operations on matrices in a far more efficient  way than using raw python matrix operations. \n",
    "Matrix operations are very commonly used when analysing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While NumPy provides a computational foundation for working with numbers, it does not have the modelling or scientific functionality of other computational packages in Python but these other packages do use NumPy's array objects. NumPy is typically used through other packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy package has many algorithms for dealing with numerical operations on arrays. Operations can be performed on NumPy arrays very quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy can also be used to simulate data. While csv data is commonly imported into NumPy for analysis or into a package such as pandas that uses NumPy, it is often handy to be able to simulate data to analyse before the real data may be collected or available.\n",

    "- A NumPy array is like a table of elements that are all of the same type. The elements which are usually numbers are indexed by a tuple of positive integers. Axes refer to the dimensions of a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy has many mathematical functions that avoid the need to use loop as they work on entire arrays of data. \n",
    "- NumPy is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data which is partly due to the way NumPy stores data in a contiguous block of memory. NumPy's algorithms can operate on this memory without any type checking. NumPy arrays use much less memory than python's own built-in sequences. \n",
    "- NumPy arrays use *vectorisation*. This is where batch operations can be performed on arrays without using loops. \n",
    "- arithmetic operations are carried out *elementwise* on an array and result in a new array being created.\n",

    "NumPy's *ndarray* is an N-dimensional or multi-dimensional array object. It is a fast and flexible container for larger datasets in Python. Mathematical operations can be performed on entire arrays using the same kind of syntax to similar operations on scalar values.  \n",
    "An ndarray can be created using the Numpy `array` function which takes any sequence-like objects such as lists, nested lists etc. Other NumPy functions create new arrays such as `zeros`, `ones`, `empty`, `arange`, `full` and `eye` among others. All these functions create an array object. \n",

The random seed can be any number but it usually comes from seconds on the computer system's clock which counts in seconds from January 1, 1970.  (known as Unix time). This ensures that the same random sequence won't be repeated unless you actually want it to. \n",
