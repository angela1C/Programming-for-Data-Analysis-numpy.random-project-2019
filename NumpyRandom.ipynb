    "\n",
    "`numpy.random` is a sub-package or module of the numpy package that generates random numbers. There are many different ways to generate random numbers which are in fact only pseudorandom numbers as computers do not actually generate random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in **random** module which implements pseudo-random numbers for various distributions. See [python docs/random library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). This built-in`random` module only samples one value at a time.\n",
    "`numpy.random` is a sub-package or module of the NumPy package that supplements the `random` module's functions with functions that can efficiently generate arrays of sample values from various probability distributions.(rather than one value at a time). It is much much faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The numpy.random package is used to generate random numbers (or pseudo random numbers) so I guess the question first is why would you want to generate random numbers!\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a data manipulation module for python with tools that operate on arrays of numbers. Base python does not have an array data structure so NumPy allows the user to create and manipulate arrays of numbers.\n",
    "NumPy is one of the most important packages for numerical and scientific computing in python and many packages that are used for data analytics are based on this package. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy functions can operate on large arrays of numbers and are therefore very useful for statistics and data analytics. NumPy is used for manipulating data in datasets that can be very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy has a `random` package which can be used to create random samples from a dataset and this is something that is used frequently in data analysis and machine learning projects. Being able to randomly select elements also has many used in applications such as gaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy.random allows you to create random samples from a dataset. I'm guessing that the `numpy.random` package works on the multi-dimensional `ndarray` arrays that are the key data structure in the `NumPy` package and would therefore be far more efficient and faster than the raw python package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input array of elements, random functions will allow you to select a random sample of elements from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create random samples with the NumPy random package which allows you to generate arrays of numbers from a particular probability distribution and this could be useful for creating a toy dataset in the absence of a real dataset or for testing or even just for learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in module called `random` which is part of the base python and this module provides a number of tools for working with random numbers. NumPy's random module is aimed more at generating random series of data rather than the scalar values which are generated by the python random module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythons built-in `random` module implements pseudo-random numbers for various distributions. See [python docs/random library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). However this built-in`random` module only samples one value at a time and probably uses loops to generate sequences of random numbers.   \n",
    "`numpy.random` provides functions that can efficiently generate arrays of sample values from various probability distributions rather than one value at a time. It is much much faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### numpy.random functions\n",
    "There are many many functions in the numpy.random package that relate to generating random numbers from different probability distributions and therefore it is not really possible to know all of these without referring to the documentation. \n",
    "Plots can illustrate the difference between different probability distributions. \n",
    "see random generation, random state, set state, get stats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating random numbers\n",
    "Numbers generated by either the built-in python `random` module or the `numpy.random` package are not actually random at all but *pseudorandom* numbers. This is because computers cannot actually generate random numbers but what they do is generate sequences that look like random numbers, so that someone else wouldn't be able to predict the next number generated without a key piece of information which is called the **seed**. If you know the seed then you can predict the next number to be generated in a sequence and therefore the numbers generated cannot be actually random as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed is typically the time (to the microsecond) on the computer when the code was run. The seed is decided when you import the function into jupyter or python script. Sometimes you may want to recreate the exact same sequence of random numbers, maybe when testing code or demonstrating something or teaching and you want the code to be reproduced. If instead of letting the seed default to the system time, you provide or **set** the seed, then the exact sequence can be reproduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random (pseudo-random) numbers are drawn from a probability distribution. The numbers generated depend on the *seed* used and are generated according to some deterministic algorithm from that seed. \n",

    "### First a quick overview of the NumPy package\n",
    "\n",
    "`NumPy` is a specialist Python package that works well with large arrays of numbers. Raw Python's built-in matrix operations are quite inefficient when compared to NumPy's capabilities. NumPy can work easily with multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy does operations on matrices in a far more efficient  way than using raw python matrix operations. \n",
    "Matrix operations are very commonly used when analysing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While NumPy provides a computational foundation for working with numbers, it does not have the modelling or scientific functionality of other computational packages in Python but these other packages do use NumPy's array objects. NumPy is typically used through other packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy package has many algorithms for dealing with numerical operations on arrays. Operations can be performed on NumPy arrays very quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy can also be used to simulate data. While csv data is commonly imported into NumPy for analysis or into a package such as pandas that uses NumPy, it is often handy to be able to simulate data to analyse before the real data may be collected or available.\n",

    "\n",
    "- NumPy is short for Numerical Python. \n",
    "- NumPy is one of the most important foundational packages for numerical computing in Python. \n",
    "- NumPy's main data structure is an `ndarray` - an a homogenuous multidimensional array. An *ndarray* is also known by the alias *array*.\n",
    "- A NumPy array is like a table of elements that are all of the same type. The elements which are usually numbers are indexed by a tuple of positive integers. Axes refer to the dimensions of a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy has many mathematical functions that avoid the need to use loop as they work on entire arrays of data. \n",
    "- NumPy is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data which is partly due to the way NumPy stores data in a contiguous block of memory. NumPy's algorithms can operate on this memory without any type checking. NumPy arrays use much less memory than python's own built-in sequences. \n",
    "- NumPy arrays use *vectorisation*. This is where batch operations can be performed on arrays without using loops. \n",
    "- arithmetic operations are carried out *elementwise* on an array and result in a new array being created.\n",

    "NumPy's *ndarray* is an N-dimensional or multi-dimensional array object. It is a fast and flexible container for larger datasets in Python. Mathematical operations can be performed on entire arrays using the same kind of syntax to similar operations on scalar values.  \n",
    "An ndarray can be created using the Numpy `array` function which takes any sequence-like objects such as lists, nested lists etc. Other NumPy functions create new arrays such as `zeros`, `ones`, `empty`, `arange`, `full` and `eye` among others. All these functions create an array object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key points about the ndarray objects include:\n",
    "- The data in an *ndarray* must be homogeneous, that is all of it's data elements must of the same type.\n",

The random seed can be any number but it usually comes from seconds on the computer system's clock which counts in seconds from January 1, 1970.  (known as Unix time). This ensures that the same random sequence won't be repeated unless you actually want it to. \n",
