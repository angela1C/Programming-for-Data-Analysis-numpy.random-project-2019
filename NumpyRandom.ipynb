    "### What exactly is a seed?\n",
    "\n",
    "A random **seed** is a number that is used to initialise a pseudorandom number generator. This number does not need to be random. By setting the seed, the original seed is ignored and numbers will be generated in a pseudorandom manner. If you reinitialise a random number generator with the same seed then the same sequence of numbers will be produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [statisticshowto](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/random-seed-definition/), a random seed specifies the start point when a computer generates a random number. The random seed can be any number but it usually comes from seconds on the computer system's clock which counts in seconds from January 1, 1970.  (known as Unix time). This ensures that the same random sequence won't be repeated unless you actually want it to. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers generate random numbers in a *deterministic* way - that is by following a set of rules. Randomness can be imitated by specifying a set of rules to follow. The algorithms behind computer number generation are based on patterns which generate numbers that follow a particular probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pynative.com/python-random-seed/\n",
    ">Random number or data generated by Python’s random module is not truly random, it is pseudo-random(it is PRNG), i.e. deterministic. It produces the numbers from some value. This value is nothing but a seed value. i.e. The random module uses the seed value as a base to generate a random number.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Generally, the seed value is the previous number generated by the generator. However, When the first time you use the random generator, there is no previous value. So by-default current system time is used as a seed value.\n",

    "#### pseudo random number generator.\n",
    "There are various methods of generating random numbers, with replacement and without replacement. With replacement means the number drawn would be placed back in and could be selected again. \n",
    "No replacement means that once a number is chosen, it can no longer be chosen again in the same sample as it is not placed back in the pot. In this way there will be no duplicates.\n",
    "it cannot be selected again in the same sample. It is no longer available and this means there will be no possibility of duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's random package and numpy.random are examples of pseudo random number generators. A true random number generator would involve hardware while pseudo random number generators involve software.\n",
    " \n",
    "Computers cant really generate random numbers, even humans have patterns in thinking of random numbers. Computers generate numbers that looks random, so that someone else wouldn't be able to predict the next number generated.\n",
    "We are really only looking at *pseudo* random numbers. If you do have a key piece of information - the **seed** - then you can predict the next random number. The seed is typically the time (to the microsecond) on the computer when the code was run. The seed is decided when you import the function into jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of **pi** from the lecture. Pi is the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference and it has a decimal expansion that never ends and never repeats. \n",
    "Therefore you will only ever see an approximation of pi becuase it has an unending expansion. \n",
    "The digits never repeat a pattern. While you might find pairs of digits, these pairs do not appear periodically. \n",
    "If you wanted to generate a random number between 1 and 10, you could go out to a point in the decimal expansion of pi and not tell anyone where you started, the position where you started from is the seed. If no-one knows where you start from , then no-one can predict where you go next. The seed is where you start at.\n",
    "\n",
    "For various applications you will want to set the seed, for example to test code etc if you want the same random numbers (pseudo-random) generated you need to set the seed.\n",
    "This tells python not to generate a random seed at the start (from the time to the microsecond on the machine) and instead provide it with a seed to start from to get the very same output another time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo random number generators can be seeded which makes them deterministic and the series of random values can be recreated and predicted. A seed is like a starting point to the random number generation process. The computer's system time is usually used for the seed and this is used in an algorithm to generate some (pseudo) random values. There are times however when you need to be able to generste exactly the same sequence of random numbers such as for testing or demonstrating/teaching etc. \n",

    "Numbers generated by either the built-in random module or numpy.random package are not actually random at all but *pseudorandom* numbers. Computers cannot actually generate random numbers but they do generate sequences that look like random numbers. Computers generate numbers that looks random, so that someone else wouldn't be able to predict the next number generated without a key piece of information. This is the **seed**. If you know the seed then you can predict the next number to be generated in a sequence and therefore the numbers generated are not random as such. The seed is typically the time (to the microsecond) on the computer when the code was run. The seed is decided when you import the function into jupyter or python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lectured demonstrated the example of **pi** which is the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference. Pi has a decimal expansion that never ends and never repeats. Therefore you only ever see an approximation of pi becuase it has an unending expansion. \n",
    "The digits in pi never repeat a pattern and while you might find pairs of digits, these pairs do not appear periodically. \n",
    "Therefore if you wanted to generate a random number between 1 and 10, you could go out to a point in the decimal expansion and not tell anyone where you started, the position where you started from is the seed. If no-one knows where you start from, then no-one can predict where you go next. The seed is where you start at. If someone knows where in the decimal expansion you started from , then they could predict the next number in the \"random\" sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For various applications, you may wish to set a seed so that the exact sequence of random numbers can be generated. For example when testing code or for teaching purposes where you want the output to be reproducible you can set the seed. This tells Python not to generate a random seed at the start (from the time to the microsecond on the machine) and instead you provide it with a seed to start from to get the very same output another time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, random (pseudorandom) numbers are drawn from a probability distribution. The numbers generated depend on the *seed* used and are generated according to some deterministic algorithm from that seed. "
