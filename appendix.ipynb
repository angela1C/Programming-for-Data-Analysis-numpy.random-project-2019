    "Computer programs produce outputs based on inputs and according to a set of predetermined rules. Pseudorandom numbers are generated in a sequence according to some **deterministic algorithm** from an input called a **seed** which is a number that is used to initialise the pseudorandom number generator. The seed used is typically the time in milliseconds on the computer when the code was run and is used as the starting point of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [statisticshowto](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/random-seed-definition/), a random seed specifies the start point when a computer generates a random number. The random seed can be any number but it usually comes from seconds on the computer system's clock which counts in seconds from January 1, 1970.  (known as Unix time). This ensures that the same random sequence won't be repeated unless you actually want it to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo random number generators can be **seeded** which makes them **deterministic**. To recreate the exact same sequence of random numbers, then you can just explicitly supply the seed as an input to the random number generator. This means that while the numbers generated look random they are not truly random but **pseudorandom**. These pseudorandom numbers  contain no real randomness at all - randomness is just being imitated - but they can take the role of random numbers for certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you reinitialise a random number generator with the same seed, the default seed is ignored and the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers will be produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "This all means that the outputs can be repeated by following the same set of steps and given the same inputs.  Therefore if you know this **seed** then you can predict the next number to be generated in a sequence.  Pseudorandom number generators should therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes because their predictability could be used to break the encryption but there are times when the exact same sequences of numbers may be required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Psuedorandom numbers are suitable for purposes such as simulating datasets, testing machine learning algorithms etc as well as ensuring reproducibility of code for code sharing, teaching and demonstration purposes.

A **random walk** can visualise this random sequence where a path is drawn that changes direction according to each number. There would be no pattern at all in a random walk as the next point is always unpredictable. Random processes are nondeterministic since they are impossible to determine in advance whereas machines are deterministic because their operation is predictable and repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1946 while involved in running computations for the military, John Neumann required quick access to randomly generated numbers that could be repeated if necessary but as the computer of the time had very limited memory it could not store long random sequences. Nuemann therefore developed an algorithm to mechanically simulate the scrambling aspect of randomness as follows.\n",
    "First a truly random numbers called the 'seed' (which could come from measurement of noise or the current time in milliseconds) is selected which is then provided as input to a very simple calculation where the seed is multiplied by itself, the middle of this output becomes the seed for the next step and the process repeated as many times as required. This was called the \"middle-squares\" method and was the first pseudorandom number generator. The randomness of the seed depends only on the randomness of the initial seed only and the same seed will generate the same sequence.\n",

    "The difference between a random generated versus a pseudorandomly generated sequence is that eventually the pseudorandom sequence will repeat when the algorithm reaches a seed it has previously used. The length before the pseudorandom sequence repeats is called the **period** and the period is strictly limited by the length of the initial seed. \n",
    "The longer the length of the initial seed the longer the period so a 4 digit seed will produce a longer period of unrepeating sequences than a 3 digit seed which is will produce a longer period than a two digit seed. \n",
    "The difference between a pseudorandom generated sequence and a truy random sequence is that there are many sequences that cannot occur in a pseudorandom sequence.  \n",
    "A 20 digit pseudorandom sequence generated from a 4-digit seed is equivalent to a uniform selection from 10,000 possible intial seeds so that only 20,000 different sequences can be generated. when we move from random to pseudorandom shifts the key space is shrunk into a much smaller seed-space.\n",
    "For a pseudorandom sequence to be indistinguishable from a randomly generated sequence, it must be impractical for a computer to try all seeds and look for a match. There is an important distinction in computer science between what is possible versus what is possible in a reasonable amount of time. With pseudorandom generators the security increases as the length of the seed increases. If the most powerful computer would take hundreds of years to run through all seeds then we can safely assume its practically secure instead of perfectly secure. As computers get faster the seed size must increase accordingly. \n",
    "Instead of having to share the entire random shift sequence in advance, you can share the relatively short random seed and expand it into the same random looking sequence when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, random (pseudorandom) numbers are drawn from a probability distribution. The numbers generated depend on the *seed* used and are generated according to some deterministic algorithm from that seed. The numbers that are output depend on the algorithm and the input seed.ß"

    "From the lecture notes.\n",
    "Demonstrated that if we wanted to get the average of a population such as the average heights of everyone in the country, but it is not possible or practical to do so. Instead in practice you might take representative random samples from the population and get the averages of this. This is a statistic which is a good estimator for the population paramter. Statistics measure estimates of parameters in a sample. There are many ways to take samples from a population and when you calculate the average of the sample it is unlikely to be the actual average for the population. Any values of a normal distribution have a probability of zero as it is a continuous distribution but the mean can be thought of as the centre of the distribution or where the values are more likely to be from.\n",
    "If a variable is normally distributed the mean is where the values are centred on and its standard deviation shows how likely a value to to be away from the mean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to get the average of all heights in a country, you could take samples of samplesize from the population and do this a number of times. \n",
    "Numpy can be used to generate data to simulate this process. You can get 1000 estimates of sample of 100 values from a normal distribution.\n",
    "Then look at the mean and standard deviations from each of the sample and see how these are distributed to get the sampling distribution of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all the values you could measure follow a particular distribrution such as the normal distribution, then\n",
    "You could measure or take a single point or value from this distribution. Instead if we take 10 values from this distribution, and calculate their mean, the mean should be quite close to the mean in the population but with some variation. Some random samples of 10 values could be randomly quite big or small or even more extreme. You can take the average of each sample and see how do they relate to the mean of the overall distributio of the population you took them from.\n",
    "Use numpy randoms standard_normal function np.random.standard_normal give some random values following a standard normal distribution. Can do it 1000 times."
