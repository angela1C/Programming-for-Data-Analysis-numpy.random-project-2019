    ">is a number chosen as if by chance from some specified distribution such that selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces the underlying distribution. Almost always, such numbers are also required to be independent, so that there are no correlations between successive numbers. Computer-generated random numbers are sometimes called pseudorandom numbers, while the term \"random\" is reserved for the output of unpredictable physical processes. When used without qualification, the word \"random\" usually means \"random with a uniform distribution.\" Other distributions are of course possible.\n",

    "**NumPy**, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important foundational packages for numerical computing in Python and many other packages that are used for data analytics and machine learning are built on NumPy. \n",
    "NumPy's main data structure is the **ndarray**. This is a homogenuous multidimensional array which is also known by the alias **array**. Python itself does not have an array data structure so NumPy allow for the creation and manipulatation of arrays of numbers. Python's own matrix operations are quite inefficient when compared to NumPy's capabilities on large multi-dimensional arrays of numbers and such matrix type operations are very commonly used when analysing data and for other computing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy array resembles a table of elements that are all of the same type. The elements which are usually numbers are indexed by a tuple of positive integers. Axes refer to the dimensions of a NumPy array.\n",
    "The NumPy package has many mathematical functions and algorithms for doing very fast numerical operations on arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch operations avoid the need to use loops by working on entire arrays of data at a time using **vectorisation** but using similar syntax to working with scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy can also be used to simulate data. While csv data is commonly imported into NumPy for analysis (or into a package such as pandas that uses NumPy), it is often useful to be able to simulate data to analyse before the real data may be collected or available. \n",
    "  \n",
    "A NumPy **ndarray** can be created using the Numpy `array` function which takes any sequence-like objects such as lists, nested lists etc but there are other NumPy functions that also create new arrays such as `zeros`, `ones`, `empty`, `arange`, `full` and `eye` among others as detailed in the [numpy quickstart tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html). NumPy's random module also creates ndarray objects (or scalars).\n",

    "Some key points about any of NumPy's ndarray objects include:\n",
    "- The data in an *ndarray* must be homogeneous, that is all of it's data elements must of the same type.\n",

    "- Arrays have a *shape* attribute which is a tuple that indicates the size of the array in each dimension.\n",
    "The length of the *shape* tupple is the number of axes that the array has. \n",

    "## NumPy's Random module \n",
    "Python has a built-in [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module that provides a number of tools for working with random numbers. However this `random` module only generates or samples one value at a time.  Loops or iteration are used for working with sequences of random numbers while on the other hand the `numpy.random` module provides functions that can efficiently generate arrays of sample values from various probability distributions rather than one value at a time. NumPy's random module is much much faster and more efficient than python's random module for this purpose particularly when working with larger arrays.\n",

    "Both Python's random and NumPy random packages generate pseudorandom numbers rather than actual random numbers. \n",
    "Actual random numbers cannot be generated by software applications. Both `random` modules implements **pseudorandom** numbers for various distributions. \n",
    "Python uses the **Mersenne Twister** as the core generator. The Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively tested random number generators in existence. According to [wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister), the Mersenne Twister is by far the most widely used general-purpose pseudorandom number generator PRNG whose name derives from the fact that its period length is chosen to be a Mersenne prime (a prime number that is one less than a power of two.

    "\n",
    "Next I look at the [numpy.random.randint()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.1/reference/generated/numpy.random.randint.html#numpy-random-randint) function which will return random integers from the **discrete uniform distribution** in the interval from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive). ($[low, high)$) \n",
    "\n",
    "**`numpy.random.randint()`** is used to generate an array of random integers. \n",
    "You must specify how many integers to be generated by providing a size parameter. You can also specify the range from which the random integers will be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four possible parameters you can give to this function but at least one is required. Size is the key word argument here which is used to specify how many random numbers should be generated.\n",
    "When only one parameter is supplied, this value is taken to be upper end of the range (exclusive) and a single integer is generated from 0 up to the upper range minus 1 so `np.random.randint(10)` would result in a single integer that could be any integer from 0 up to 9. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a second value is supplied to the function, the first valuer is treated as the low range parameter and the second is treated as the high range parameter so `np.random.randint(5,10)` would output a single integer between 5 inclusive and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two arguments relate to the range of values that could be drawn where low is the lowest integer to draw from the distribution, high is the integer after the last possible integer that could be drawn. The next numeric parameter is for the size of the resulting array. This can be a single integer or a tuple of integers for higher dimensions. This will determine the shape and size of the output. If the given shape is, e.g., (m, n, k), then m * n * k samples are drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an argument is provides for the size, then a  size-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate distribution will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last possible argument is an optional `dtype` parameter which determines the dtype of the integers in the resulting array. This is not always required as the default value is `np.int` \n",
    "\n",
    "The `numpy.random.random_integers` function is similar to `numpy.random.randint` but the `numpy.random.random_integers` function is now deprecated. `numpy.random.random_integers` had a closed interval [low, high] with 1 being the lowest value if high is omitted and was used to generate uniformly distributed discrete non-integers.\n",

    "A **seed** is a number that is used to initialise a pseudorandom number generator. By setting the seed, the original seed is ignored and numbers will be generated in a pseudorandom manner. If you reinitialise a random number generator with the same seed then the same sequence of numbers will be produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [statisticshowto](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/random-seed-definition/), a random seed specifies the start point when a computer generates a random number. The random seed can be any number but it usually comes from seconds on the computer system's clock which counts in seconds from January 1, 1970.  (known as Unix time). This ensures that the same random sequence won't be repeated unless you actually want it to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programs generate random numbers in a *deterministic* way - that is they follow a very particular set of rules to generate the random numbers, which means therefore that the random numbers are not actually random at all!\n",
    "Randomness is instead being imitated. The algorithms behind computer number generation are based on patterns which generate numbers that follow particular **probability distributions**. Setting a seed will produce the same sequence of random numbers each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://pynative.com/python-random-seed/\n",
    ">Random number or data generated by Python’s random module is not truly random, it is pseudo-random(it is PRNG), i.e. deterministic. It produces the numbers from some value. This value is nothing but a seed value. i.e. The random module uses the seed value as a base to generate a random number.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Generally, the seed value is the previous number generated by the generator. However, When the first time you use the random generator, there is no previous value. So by-default current system time is used as a seed value.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to generate pseudo-random numbers. Python uses the **Mersenne Twister** as the core generator. According to [wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister), the Mersenne Twister is  a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) and is by far the most widely used general-purpose PRNG whose name derives from the fact that its period length is chosen to be a Mersenne prime (a prime number that is one less than a power of two. That is, it is a prime number of the form Mn = 2n − 1 for some integer n.).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times when you may wish to recreate the exact same sequence of random numbers.  Pseudo random number generators can be **seeded** which makes them **deterministic** and the series of random values can therefore be exactly recreated. A seed is an input to the random number generator as the starting point of the process. The computer's system time is usually used for the seed and this is used in an algorithm to generate some (pseudo) random values. If you provide the seed as an input to the process this tells the program not to generate its own random seed at the start from the computer's clock (to the microsecond) but instead use the seed you provide\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",

    "When I use the `random.seed` method with any integer (in the accepatable range) then the same sequence of random numbers will be generated when this number is used to seed the generator again. It doesn't matter what number is used as the seed as long as the same number is used as a seed again when you want to generate the exact same sequence. If a different seed is used, then a different sequence of random numbers will be generated. The output of a random function will depend on the seed used and the algorithm the function uses. \n",
    "Without explicitly specifying a seed, a seed is generated from the system clock. If you don't specify a seed it would be extremely difficult to reprodce the same sequence again. As the default seed is set from the computer systems internal clock (to the millisecond) the seed will change every moment that you use a numpy random function.\n",
